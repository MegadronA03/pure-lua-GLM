# pure-lua-GLM
lua implementation of GLM library

Supports swizzelling and standart operations with vectors:

"+-*/", cross and dot product, length and normalize

if you need to directly import this library(copy the code), copy contents of glmvec.min.lua into a function, call it and function will return library methods(same as require())
