# pure-lua-GLM
lua implementation of GLSL vector operations syntax

Supports swizzelling and other generic operations with vectors:

"+-*/", cross and dot product, length and normalize

if you need to directly import this library(copy the code), copy contents of glmvec.min.lua into a function, call it and function will return library methods(same as require())

made specifically for TIC-80, thats why there's code generation.
